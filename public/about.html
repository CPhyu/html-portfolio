<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Cynthia!  I have started to learn web development because, for one, I'm interested in it and two, there is a great need for a <br>
  learning platform like Udemy in our native language, especially for students who can't afford higher education.  This is the reason I'm pursuing <br>
  this skill to create something that will help many students across the nation.   I'm learning to become a web developer in addition to <br>
  training young leaders to reach their full potential in many aspects of their lives.</p>
