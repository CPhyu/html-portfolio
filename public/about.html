<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Cynthia!  I have started to learn web development because, for one, I'm interested in it and two, there have been <br>
  several incidents that led me to pursuing this more urgently.  I'm learning to become a web developer in addition to <br>
  training young leaders to read their full potential in many aspects of their lives.</p>
